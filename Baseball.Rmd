## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

random

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}


batting<-Batting

batting2000s <- batting |> subset(batting$yearID > 1999)

batting_filler <- batting |> subset(1949 < batting$yearID) 

batting_50s_70s <- batting_filler |> subset(batting_filler$yearID < 1980)

batting_modern <- batting2000s |> subset(batting2000s$AB > 400)

batting_old <- batting_50s_70s |> subset(batting_50s_70s$AB > 400)

batting_modern_final <- batting_modern |> subset(batting_modern$G > 100)

batting_old_final <- batting_old |> subset(batting_old$G > 100) |> 

summary(batting_old_final$HR)

summary(batting_modern_final$HR)

batting_old_final$Salary_Z <- scale(df$my_column)



```

```{r, eval=FALSE}

BBBBBB<-Salaries

```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
